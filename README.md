This system automates the process of sending daily email and SMS reminders based on a schedule maintained in a Google Sheets document. The system retrieves the assigned person for the day, as well as their contact information (email and phone number) from the sheet, and sends notifications before scheduled events. It works by executing the `sendDailyAdhanReminders` function daily, triggered via a manually set Google Apps Script trigger. The events and their times are listed in the sheet, and the system schedules reminders 30 minutes before each event (or 1 minute in test mode), using Twilio for SMS and Gmail for email. Each reminder is set with a time-based trigger that is automatically created and deleted after the notification is sent. The script is configurable via a `config` object, where users can set the Google Sheets ID, Twilio credentials, and email settings. This system is flexible and can be adapted for various reminder-based scenarios, such as task assignments, meeting reminders, or appointment notifications, leveraging Google Sheets for scheduling and Twilio for SMS communication.
